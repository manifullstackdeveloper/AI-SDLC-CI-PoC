# NestJS Patterns

**Follow NestJS patterns from `.standards/common-standards.md`.**

## Quick Reference

- Use modules to organize features
- Controllers handle HTTP requests/responses only
- Services contain business logic
- DTOs for all data transfer with validation
- Use dependency injection for all dependencies
- Logger instance in every service
- Proper HTTP status codes (201 for create, 204 for delete, etc.)
- Exception filters for error handling

**Complete NestJS patterns**: See `.standards/common-standards.md` → NestJS Patterns section
