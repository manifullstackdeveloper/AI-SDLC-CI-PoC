# AI Coding Standards for SDLC1

**Follow the common coding standards defined in `.standards/common-standards.md`.**

## Quick Reference

**Core**: Strict TypeScript, no `any` types, class-validator DTOs, Logger in services, proper HTTP codes, error handling, unit tests, dependency injection, input validation, operation logging.

**Security**: No sensitive logs, validate inputs, proper status codes, graceful errors.

**Quality**: ESLint clean, Prettier formatted, 80%+ coverage, all tests pass.

**NestJS**: Modules, controllers (HTTP only), services (business logic), DTOs with validation, dependency injection, Logger in every service, proper HTTP status codes, exception filters.

**Complete standards**: See `.standards/common-standards.md`
